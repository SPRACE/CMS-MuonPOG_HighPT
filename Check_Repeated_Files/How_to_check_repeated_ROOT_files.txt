              Check Repeated ROOT files from CRAB
____________________________________________________________________

Sometimes we need to resubmit jobs, which may produce duplicated ROOT
files. In order to check which files are duplicated (triplicated...),
copy the script "Check_RepeatedFiles.py" into your ACCESS account.
Then type

     python Check_RepeatedFiles.py

and follow instructions from the script. It will ask you to write the
path containing the list of ROOT files received from CRAB (which are
expected to be in the T2 STORAGE).

As result, the script will pop up the list of duplicated ROOT files
for each kind of ROOT sample. Your job is to remove the duplicated
file. But make sure to delete that one of small size.

CAUTION: this script uses other script located in Angelo Santos' /home/
directory. In case you found any problem related to that, please, mail
to "angelo.santos@cern.ch".
