       	Choosing Best Pairs of Tag & Probe Muons
____________________________________________________________________

In order to get a collection of selected T&P pairs, a macro file has
been created to have a workflow to mark such pairs as "good" or "bad".
In the end, a new ROOT file is produced containing a new variable
called "pair_BestPair" carrying values "1" and "0" if the pairs were
labeled as "good" or "bad", respectively.

The clean up of T&P pairs is done only requiring pairs with the best
Chi2/NDF, e.g., with the Chi2/NDF closest to 1.

In this guide, you will find instruction to:
   (a) generate the new trees with the workflow of cleaning up, and
       will do that via CONDOR;
   (b) gather ROOT files and informations received from CONDOR jobs.

____________________________________________________________________
(a) To select the best pairs of T&P muons, firstly copy these three
scripts to your ACCESS account. Put them in a same directory:
   ### macro file to run the workflow to select the best pairs
   addBestPair_RunEvent_v9.cxx
   ### pytho script to submit jobs via CONDOR
   Cleaning_TPpairs_v4.py
   ### script to gather ROOT files and informations from CONDOR jobs
   Gather_information_from_Results.py

All of these scripts are well commented and you need only to follow
its instructions:
   * setup input parameters inside "Cleaning_TPpairs_v4.py"
   * run script
     	 python Cleaning_TPpairs_v4.py
     and follow instructions

Depends on your needs, its is also possible to setup this script to:
   * create a variable called "pair_passBaselineSelections" to encompass
     selected pairs from "pair_BestPair" and also from addition selections
     pre-defined by the User;
   * or create "pair_passBaselineSelections" with selections containing
     only the addition cuts pre-defined by the User;
   * or create only variable "pair_BestPair".

____________________________________________________________________
(b) When all jobs finished, run

   python Gather_information_from_Results.py

and follow its instructions.

In case of needing to move the new ROOT files (with the additional
variables) to the T2 STORAGE, follow instructions in item (b) of guide
