                     How to Merge ROOT Files
____________________________________________________________________

This tutorial helps on:
   (a) how to merge ROOT files (which are expected to be in the T2 STORAGE);
   (b) how to move the merged ROOT files to a path in the T2 STORAGE.

(a) First of all, login into your ACCESS account and then type:

   source /home/assantos/scripts/create_list_of_StorageFiles.sh hadd /pnfs/sprace.org.br/data/cms/store/user/bla/bla/bla/

where bla/bla/bla is the rest of the path where the ROOT files are
placed in. Such command create a list of ROOT files called lll.txt.

Then change the list name:

     mv lll.txt file

To merge the ROOT files in the list, run the command

   source /home/assantos/scripts/haddScript.sh file

Depending on the number of input files or on their size, this step
may get stuck, needing to split the list "lll.txt" in two or more
file lists. This is because we have not created a script to make it
easier than this. User has to do it carefully and sample-by-sample.
Take also care of using file names accordingly.

(b) As soon as files were merged, you may copy them to a path in the
T2 STORAGE. Just type:

   python /home/assantos/scripts/copy_from_ACCESS_to_T2_SPRACE.py

and follow the script instructions.

CAUTION: scripts mentioned above are located in Angelo Santos' /home/
directory. In case you found any problem related to that, please, mail
