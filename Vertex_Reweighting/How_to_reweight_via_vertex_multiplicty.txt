        How to Apply the Reweighting via Vertex Multiplicity
____________________________________________________________________

The MC samples have to be reweighted concerning the vertex
multiplicity from Data events using the macro

   MuonAnalysis/TagAndProbe/test/zmumu/addNVtxWeight.cxx

The macro addNVtxWeight.cxx compares the vertex multiplicity
distribution from Data with that one from a MC sample. After
normalizing these distributions, differences from their shapes
are taking into account to create a variable called weight inside
the new MC ROOT file. This step has to be done for each MC sample.

   cd CMSSW_5_3_10/src/MuonAnalysis/TagAndProbe/test/zmumu/

and type the following command:

   root  -b -l -q  <MC ROOT sample>  <Data ROOT sample>  addNVtxWeight.cxx+

It will create a .png file showing distributions of vertex multiplicity
of the Data and MC samples used, as well as the correspondent new MC ROOT
file containing that additional variable weight. This variable carries the
weights to be applied later on to the events of the corresponding MC sample.

### Obs: macro "addNVtxWeight.cxx" has been created when User followed
    the instructions on
    CMS-MuonPOG_HighPT/Initial_Trees/How_to_create_initial_trees.txt
